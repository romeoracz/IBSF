      Independent damp survey near me
    </h1>
    <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-navy-muted leading-relaxed">
      If you are searching for an <strong>independent damp survey near me</strong> in Southampton, Winchester or London, Independent Building Science and Forensics (IBSF) provides forensic-level damp investigations with no ties to remediation contractors. Our independent damp surveys use instrument-led diagnostics—moisture mapping, thermal imaging and environmental data logging—to identify the true cause of damp in your property.

    <h2 class="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold text-navy">What makes our damp survey different?</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-navy-muted leading-relaxed">
      Many damp surveys are conducted by companies that also sell treatments. This creates a conflict of interest. Our <strong>independent damp survey</strong> is non-remedial: we diagnose but do not sell fixes. Every finding is backed by calibrated instruments and recorded data. Reports are suitable for insurance disputes, landlord-tenant disputes and litigation.
