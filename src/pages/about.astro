        Our work is underpinned by a PhD in Chemical Engineering and ongoing continuing professional development (CPD) in building pathology, damp and moisture, and indoor air quality. We hold relevant independent certifications and maintain professional indemnity insurance. Scientific methodology is applied to every investigation: we do not rely on visual assessment alone; we quantify moisture, ventilation and environmental loading using instrument-led, data-logged diagnostics.

      <p class="mt-2 text-navy-muted leading-relaxed">
        Independent Building Science and Forensics (IBSF) is a non-remedial consultancy. We have no financial ties to contractors, remediation firms or product suppliers. Our only interest is accurate, defensible findings and clear causation analysis—whether you are an insurer, solicitor, developer or high-end residential client. Evidence-based practice and legal defensibility are central.

      <h2 id="practice-heading" class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy">Practice</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 text-navy-muted leading-relaxed">
        We are commissioned for complex or high-value cases where clarity, independence and defensible conclusions are critical. Reports are structured for dispute resolution, insurance and litigation. Professional conduct, confidentiality and timely delivery are standard. The tone is measured, rational and expert—not sales-led.
