        Independent Building Science & Forensics is an impartial consultancy committed to evidence-based diagnostics and unbiased reports. We have no financial ties to contractors, remediation firms or product suppliers. Our only interest is giving you accurate findings and clear recommendations—whether you are a homebuyer, landlord, insurer or legal party.

        We focus on high-value work: diagnostics that matter for your decision-making or dispute resolution. We communicate clearly, avoid jargon where possible, and deliver reports that you can use with contractors, insurers or solicitors. Professional conduct, confidentiality and timely delivery are standard.
