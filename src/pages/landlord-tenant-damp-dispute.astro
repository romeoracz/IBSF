      Landlord tenant damp dispute: independent forensic evidence
    </h1>
    <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-navy-muted leading-relaxed">
      Damp disputes between landlords and tenants frequently turn on causation: is the damp caused by a building defect, or by occupant behaviour and condensation? Without independent, instrument-led evidence, liability remains unclear and disputes escalate. Independent Building Science and Forensics provides <strong>landlord tenant damp dispute</strong> reports that isolate causation using recorded environmental data.

    <h2 class="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold text-navy">Why independent evidence matters</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-navy-muted leading-relaxed">
      Reports from remediation contractors often recommend work that serves their commercial interest. An <strong>independent damp dispute report</strong> from IBSF has no remedial bias. We use moisture mapping, thermal imaging, hygrothermal logging and ventilation assessment to document cause and extent. Our reports are structured for insurers, solicitors and the courts.
