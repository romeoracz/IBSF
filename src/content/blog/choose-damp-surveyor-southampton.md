When you need a damp survey in Southampton or elsewhere in Hampshire, choosing the right surveyor can save you money and avoid unnecessary remedial work. Here’s what to look for.

## Why independence matters

Many firms that offer damp surveys also sell treatments—injections, tanking, ventilation systems. That creates a conflict of interest: the same company may diagnose “rising damp” and then quote for the fix. An **independent damp survey** means the surveyor has no financial stake in the remedy. They are paid only for the survey and report, so their findings are not influenced by selling you work.

Look for a surveyor who:

- Does not recommend specific contractors or products
- Uses moisture meters, thermal imaging and (where relevant) environmental logging to distinguish between rising damp, penetrating damp and condensation
- Provides a written report with cause analysis and clear recommendations

## Credentials and insurance

Check that your damp surveyor holds relevant qualifications and continuing professional development (CPD) in building pathology or damp and moisture. Professional indemnity insurance is essential—it protects you if the report is wrong or misleading.

## Damp survey cost in Southampton

Damp survey cost varies with property size and complexity. Be wary of very cheap “free” surveys that are really a sales visit for remedial work. A proper independent damp survey Southampton or damp survey Hampshire will have a clear fee for the inspection and report. Ask for a fixed quote before booking.

## What you should receive

After the visit you should get:

- A written report identifying the cause (or causes) of damp
- Moisture data or maps where relevant
- Clear remedial recommendations, without specifying particular contractors
- Photos and annotations to support the findings
