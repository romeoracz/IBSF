Adding insulation or double glazing improves energy efficiency but can lead to **condensation after insulation** or **condensation after double glazing** if ventilation isn’t considered. Here’s why it happens and what you can do.

## Why condensation increases

Insulation and better windows reduce heat loss. That’s good for bills, but it also means:

- Less warmth reaching cold surfaces (e.g. single-skin walls, window reveals)
- Warmer, moister air staying inside
- Moisture from cooking, bathing and breathing with nowhere to go

Result: water vapour condenses on the coldest surfaces. You see misting, damp patches and eventually mould—especially in corners, behind furniture and in poorly ventilated rooms.

## The fix: ventilation and moisture control

**Ventilation** is essential. Options include:

- Extract fans in bathrooms and kitchens (correctly sized and maintained)
- Trickle vents in windows (and using them)
- Whole-house or room-level mechanical ventilation where appropriate

A **ventilation audit after retrofit** or **ventilation inspection after insulation** can identify shortfalls and recommend cost-effective improvements. The aim is to balance **airtightness vs ventilation**: enough fresh air to control moisture and air quality without wasting heat.

## Condensation after double glazing

**Condensation after double glazing** is common when:

- Old single-glazed windows acted as a “cold sink” and condensed moisture that was then absorbed or evaporated
- New double glazing is much warmer inside, so moisture stays in the air and condenses elsewhere (e.g. walls, reveals)

Improving extract ventilation and avoiding moisture build-up (drying clothes outside or in vented rooms, covering pans, etc.) usually helps. In persistent cases, a **ventilation audit** can pinpoint underperforming extracts or missing ventilation.

## When to call in an expert

If you have persistent condensation or mould after insulation or new windows, an independent **ventilation audit after retrofit** or **condensation survey** can:

- Confirm that condensation (not rising or penetrating damp) is the cause
- Measure humidity and extract performance
- Recommend ventilation or lifestyle changes
