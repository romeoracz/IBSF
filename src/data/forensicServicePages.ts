      { q: 'What is the difference between rising damp and penetrating damp?', a: 'Rising damp is ground moisture drawn upward through masonry by capillary action, typically limited to 1–1.5m above floor level. Penetrating damp enters through the building envelope — walls, roof, windows or defective details — driven by rain or hydrostatic pressure. The treatment for each is fundamentally different, which is why accurate diagnosis matters.' },
      { q: 'How do you diagnose condensation versus rising damp?', a: 'We use hygrothermal data logging, moisture mapping and psychrometric analysis. Condensation occurs when warm, moisture-laden air meets cold surfaces below dew point. We measure surface temperatures, relative humidity and ventilation rates to determine whether the moisture source is environmental or structural.' },
      { q: 'Do you recommend damp-proofing companies?', a: 'No. IBSF is a non-remedial consultancy. We diagnose and report. We never recommend specific contractors or treatments because this would compromise our independence — the very thing that gives our reports credibility in disputes and court.' },
      { q: 'How long does a forensic damp investigation take?', a: 'A site visit typically takes 2–4 hours depending on property size. Where data logging is required (e.g. to monitor environmental conditions over time), loggers are deployed for 7–28 days. Reports are delivered within 5–10 working days of final data collection.' },

    problem: 'Litigation and formal disputes require expert building reports that meet court standards. Evidence must be robust, methodology defensible and conclusions clearly reasoned. The expert\'s duty is to the court — not to the instructing party.',
    problemDetail: 'Expert witness evidence in building disputes is subject to scrutiny under CPR Part 35. The expert must demonstrate independence, competence and a transparent methodology. Reports that lack data, rely on opinion without measurement, or show partisanship are challenged under cross-examination and risk being excluded. IBSF provides expert building reports that are built on instrument-verified data and scientific methodology.',
    risk: 'Weak or partisan expert evidence undermines cases and can result in adverse costs orders. Instructions must be conflict-free and the expert must be genuinely independent.',
    riskDetail: 'Courts are increasingly critical of expert witnesses who lack genuine expertise, produce opinion-based reports or demonstrate bias toward the instructing party. Our reports are underpinned by calibrated instrument data, recorded measurements and a repeatable methodology that withstands scrutiny.',
    investigation: 'We deliver expert building reports and litigation support where instructions are clear and conflict-free. Methodology is transparent, data-led and repeatable. We have experience with County Court, High Court and arbitration proceedings.',

      { q: 'What is CPR Part 35?', a: 'CPR Part 35 governs expert evidence in civil proceedings in England and Wales. It requires experts to be independent, to owe a duty to the court (not the instructing party), and to provide a statement of truth. Reports must describe methodology, declare conflicts of interest and present balanced conclusions.' },
      { q: 'Do you attend court?', a: 'Yes. Where required, we attend trial, hearing or expert conference (hot-tubbing). We are experienced in presenting evidence and responding to cross-examination.' },
      { q: 'Can you be instructed as a single joint expert?', a: 'Yes. We are comfortable acting as a single joint expert where the court directs it. Our independence means we produce the same conclusions regardless of which party instructs us.' },
      { q: 'What types of building disputes have you given evidence on?', a: 'Damp and moisture disputes, water ingress causation, condensation and ventilation failure, building defect liability, material failure, insurance coverage disputes and professional negligence claims.' },
